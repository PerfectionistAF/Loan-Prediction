# CSE338: Data Mining and Business Intelligence
Major Task
Loan prediction is a common data mining problem which most retail banks solve on a 
daily basis. Itâ€™s the process of predicting who deserves to receive a given loan and at what 
rate based on certain characteristics of the borrower, be it an individual or a company. 
Those characteristics are mined for their use in a risk assessment process to determine 
the amount of risks the lender (the bank) will be incurring when loaning the particular 
individual/company. For example, some banks can model their interest rate for lending 
based on how much risk their model assumes a certain individual pose, and thereby 
require higher interest rates for those who pose higher risks of default and vice versa.
In our project, we use data mining techniques to analyze and predict whether a certain 
individual can be allowed to take a loan from our bank or whether said individual shall be 
denied the loan. This will be based on a set of features like marital status, education, 
employments and other features within the restrictions of the dataset we were provided. 
We will apply various data mining techniques to achieve our required goal where we end 
up with a classification model that we will train and later test
